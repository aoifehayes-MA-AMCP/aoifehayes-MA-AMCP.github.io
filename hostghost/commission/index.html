  <section><p><em>a plan of a plan</em> is an unfinished artwork by Lily O’Shea that is based on the
structure of a staircase. It is accompanied by a text titled life in a project:
a time of no time which explores the relationship between project work and
precarity. The research process involved in this work focuses on the pressures
surrounding creative pursuit and the issue of affording the time and space to
maintain a sustainable art practice.</p>
<p><img src="/media/stairs.jpeg" alt="a plan of a plan">

<h2 id="commission-process">Commission Process</h2>
<p>The commissioning of a plan of a plan can be split into two processes – curating and the curatorial. While these are separate processes, their intersection is inevitable.</p>
<p><em>a plan of a plan’s</em> production timeline was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issuing of brief: <strong>30th January 2022</strong></li>
<li>First Meeting: <strong>6th February 2022</strong></li>
<li>Check-ins: <strong>as required</strong></li>
<li>Installation: <strong>7th April 2022</strong></li>
<li>Artists&rsquo; talk: <strong>9th April 2022</strong></li>
<li>Uninstall: <strong>9th April 2022 (evening)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This timeline was developed after the initial meeting with Lily O’Shea. At this
point the brief had been issued and potential concepts were being explored and
ideas beginning to germinate. Evidently, this is a sparse production timeline
that represents a bureaucratic step.</p>
<p>The casual nature of this timeline is reflective of my curatorial choice to
withdraw. I decided that I did not want to dictate the parameters of the
artist’s work schedule or set deadlines within this period. This is not to say
that I was removed from the process as curator – naturally, I was available and
on hand throughout the process to offer any support or advice required.</p>
<p>Reflecting now, the vagueness of this production timeline succeeded in giving
complete agency to the artist over their time and labour. I understand now that
the act of curating is not simply an act of bureaucracy – but <em>compassionate
bureaucracy</em>.</p>
<h2 id="commission-brief">Commission Brief</h2>
<p>Below is the issued commission brief that resulted in the construction of *a plan
of a plan. The brief invited Lily to take the title <em>host/ghost</em> and below notes
on approach as a starting point and encouraged personal and reflective
interpretation.</p>
<p>The commission brief was primarily concerned with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The experience of belonging and identity in Cork city and the distortion of this experience through a culture of neglect.</li>
<li>The urban environment – characterised by misused space, difficulty in sustaining creative practice and resulting curtailed ‘productivity’.</li>
<li>The pandemic’s exacerbation of our contemporary state of precarity.</li>
<li>The construction of new identities of place without commodifying current identities.</li>
<li>A process-led practice and documentation of process through photographic or text reflections</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-approach">Initial Approach</h2>
<p>The proposed approach prioritised process, the local, agency and care and
initially valued the experience of this approach over the production of a final
project. The approach was rooted in reflective thought, engaged research and
caring consideration for the place-making process. An emphasis was placed on
everyday meditations – demonstrating that a socially conscious practice need not
be abruptly disruptive or radical in its active critique. The commission
encouraged documentation from an early stage of production in the form of
journaling, voice-note musings/notes app rants, scribbles, doodles etc.</p>
<p>It was the intention that this approach would remove host/ghost from the realm
of performativity and contribute to constructive place-making, while also
affording those involved a sense of belonging.</p>
<h2 id="executed-approach">Executed Approach</h2>
<p>It quickly became clear that the proposed approach was not sustainable within
the production timeline and did not lend itself to constructive place-making,
slowness or situatedness. By advocating slowness, I risked reproducing the
conditions I sought to dismantle. I learned here that identifying a sustainable
curatorial approach is not a choice between fast and slow but demands respect
for the variety of individual experiences within lived time.</p>
<p>Now, I understand the role of curator as that of a timekeeper, involving the
negotiation of both my time and the time of others. It was my initial intention
that the commission would produce new work in direct response to a space,
however this was not possible as the venue was secured late in the process. This
restriction inspired a shift within my research interests from concepts of
place-making and identity towards issues of temporalities, labour and
chronopolitics.</p>
<p>Following this revelation, accelerating towards the installation date took
precedence and the idealised vision of luxuriating in the process was somewhat
abandoned. The approach transformed into one that practiced refusal, subversion
and withdrawal rather than <em>slowness</em>.</p>
<p>This new approach gave agency to both Lily and myself over our time and labour,
allowing us to determine the parameters of our daily rest and work.</p>
<p>As a result, a plan of a plan became the anchor of this research and continues
to inform my practice. The staircase structure is something real and tangible
and demonstrates a sustainable framework for artistic production.</p>
<p>Once <em>a plan of a plan</em> was assembled in situ, the upstairs mezzanine felt
grounded – this was the missing piece.</p>
