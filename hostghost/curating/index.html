  <section><p>Detailed here are the practical elements of curating <em>a plan of a plan</em>. Sensitive information such as budget and contract are included in full in the appendices accompanying the introduction to this portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="hostghost-commission-budget"><em>host/ghost</em> commission budget</h2>
<p>Lily O’Shea was paid an artist fee for her work. Installation costs were low and the venue cost was split between the three producers occupying St Peter’s.</p>
<h2 id="contract">Contract</h2>
<p>A letter of agreement was issued to Lily O’Shea on 30th March 2022. This
contract confirmed O’Shea’s agreement to create new work for <em>host/ghost</em> in
response to the issued commission brief.</p>
<p>This letter also provided details of the installation timeline and exhibition run and confirmed the agreed fee.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation of <em>a plan of a plan</em> was quick and simple – perhaps partly because it had to be. Installation consumed 15 minutes of Lily’s 30 minute lunchbreak from her fulltime job in retail.</p>
<h2 id="meetings--check-ins">Meetings &amp; Check-ins</h2>
<p>Admittedly, my liaison and interaction with the artist was minimal during the production process. While this was not the original intention, the temporality of producing within a larger festival and academic framework made time scarce and contact infrequent.</p>
<p>However, as a result, Lily was afforded agency over her time and labour and was not subjugated to constant deadlines, self-assessments or displays of productivity.</p>
