  <section><p>The primary collective roles of the PR department included the creation of a
press pack and press release and liaison with the public, media and critical
friends.</p>
<p>PR meetings were held weekly during the 12-week production timeline and more
regularly in the lead up to the publication of our press release, press pack and
festival launch event.</p>
<h2 id="press-release-and-press-pack">Press Release and Press Pack</h2>
<p>The creation of a press release required the identification of Rebound Arts
Festival’s unique selling point.</p>
<p>The PR department concluded that our USPs included the pop-up nature of the
festival, the diversity of cultural backgrounds within the group of producers, a
primarily female-led production team, our artist-centred vision and our ambition
to programme 18 events under the umbrella of one festival.</p>

<h2 id="my-pr-role">My PR Role</h2>
<p>My individual role within the PR department was as the graphic design liaison, which involved careful planning with the marketing department.</p>
<p>The graphic design elements required included: logos, festival programme, posters, postcards, timetables and a map.</p>
<p>The process of developing a visual identity for Rebound Arts Festival began with a design brief issued by the marketing department. This brief was sent to Niamh, a graphic designer at the creative agency Babelfís. I liaised with Niamh to ensure this vision was executed. This involved reviewing and revising multiple drafts, which proved to be a challenging and time consuming process. Challenges were faced and overcome, as evident in the success of Rebound’s marketing efforts and visual presence visible both online and around Cork city.</p>
<p>My role contributed to the success of the festival and required extensive attention to detail, focus and time management.
The branding that was developed celebrates Cork’s iconic buildings through bold and vibrant illustrations that perfectly capture the energy and mission of Rebound Arts Festival.</p>
