      <description>a plan of a plan is an unfinished artwork by Lily O’Shea that is based on the structure of a staircase. It is accompanied by a text titled life in a project: a time of no time which explores the relationship between project work and precarity. The research process involved in this work focuses on the pressures surrounding creative pursuit and the issue of affording the time and space to maintain a sustainable art practice.</description>

      <title>a plan of a plan and the curatorial</title>

      <description>Curatorial projects are increasingly understood as ongoing research projects rather than once off events. As such, I wish to outline my intention to carry the framework identified in the process of curating a plan of a plan through to future practice and research.
While host/ghost was specific to Cork and the local context of urban neglect and dereliction, the curatorial here encompasses a wider approach to practice rooted in sustainable and interdependent practice.</description>

      <description>Crush 21st June – 26th April 2022, First Floor Corridor Backwater Artists Group “Having a ‘crush’ is about texture&amp;hellip;My surface gets all uneven, my underneath shows through, things shine up suddenly. It’s like ‘being’ crushed material, but also like wearing it, alternately slithery and itchy” – Elizabeth Freeman
Crush is an exhibition of work by four Backwater Artists Group studio members that demonstrates a nuance of textures. The exhibition explores everyday life through the materiality of texture, conveying transactions between objects, people, landscapes and labour over time.</description>
