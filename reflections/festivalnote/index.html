  <section><p>I am reflecting on the concept of festival – a word that has defined the past year in many ways.</p>
<p>The concept of festival represents an experimental social space and undertaking. The diversity of events presented at Rebound Arts Festival demonstrates playfulness  regarding perceptions of what a festival can be and what it can lead to.</p>
<p>Emerging from pandemic-related lockdowns, there was a sense that a celebration like Rebound Arts Festival had been delayed – which made it all the more special as it unfolded.</p>
<p>Something that was alluded to several times throughout the year was the feeling that a festival produces – the feeling that you are in an alternative temporal space, a space of collectivity with others. This feeling was felt strongly during Rebound Arts Festival weekend – a sense of shared responsibility, support and magic. This feeling is interdependence in action.</p>
